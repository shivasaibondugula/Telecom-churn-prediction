# Telecom-churn-prediction
> You are required to model to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc. It should also be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.

## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a ML model for prediction of telecom churn based on available independent variables.
- For this project, we are using the data provided - [data set](train.csv).

## Conclusions
- We built multiple models using Logistic regression, Decision trees and Random forests along with hyperparameter tuning. We also implemented dimensionality reduction using PCA.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.9.13
- Numpy - version 1.21.5
- Pandas - version 1.4.4
- Matplotlib - version 3.5.2
- Seaborn - version 0.11.2
- sklearn - version 1.0.2
- statsmodels - version 0.13.2

## Acknowledgements
- This project is developed as part of the Machine learning 2 course required for Executive Post Graduate Diploma in Machine Learning and AI from IIIT Bangalore.
